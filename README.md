# Combat Achievement Ironlock

A single-page OSRS-inspired companion HUD where Combat Achievements are the currency to unlock skills, quests, and shops.

## Features
- App-like navigation bar that swaps between the Task Board, Unlock Console, and Rune Journal without page scrolling.
- Task Board with tier filters and completed toggle so you can bank CA points quickly.
- Unlock Console with segmented tabs for skills, quests, and shops; skill costs start at 1 point and grow by +1 per purchase.
- Rune Journal feed that tracks completions, unlocks, manual point adjustments, and resets alongside live unlock totals.
- Quick CA point modal and toast feedback to keep the experience feeling like an in-game plug-in.
