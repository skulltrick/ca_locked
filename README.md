# Combat Achievement Ironlock

A single-page OSRS-themed tracker for an Ironman mode where Combat Achievements act as currency to unlock skills, quests, and shops.

## Features
- OSRS-inspired styling with modern components (task board, unlock panels, rune journal).
- Dynamic CA task list with sample challenges and point rewards.
- Unlock costs that mirror the requested rules: skills start at 1 point and scale by +2 for each purchase; quests cost their quest point reward; shops cost 1 point each.
- Adventure log (Rune Journal) that records every completion and unlock decision.
- Modal to add custom CA points so you can mirror an in-game profile.
